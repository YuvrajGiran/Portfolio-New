          <h2>About</h2>
          <p>
            Im Yuvraj, a passionate software engineer who loves building technology that makes a real impact. I’m especially drawn to projects where code can solve everyday problems, whether that’s making businesses more efficient, helping people live healthier lives, or supporting sustainability.

            I thrive on learning new tools and frameworks, and I enjoy the challenge of turning complex ideas into simple, user-friendly applications. From crafting clean, scalable code to collaborating on GitHub, I approach every project with curiosity and a drive to keep improving.

            Beyond the technical side, I care deeply about using software for good. One of my recent projects was building a marketplace web app to repurpose materials that would otherwise end up in landfills; blending creativity, sustainability, and tech.

            For me, engineering isn’t just about writing code; it’s about problem-solving, teamwork, and leaving things better than I found them.
